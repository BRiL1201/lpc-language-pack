# lpc-language-pack

Custom Atom Editor HTML language primarily for my job. Customized syntax highlighting for inline style and class attributes, image tags, anchors tags, href and src attributes. Is meant as a replacement for the standard HTML grammar.

The odd img and anchor tag colorings can be commented out/removed in the less file. They're colored this way as a lot of our editing is based solely around these tags, so they stand out a bit more.

Modeled after [language-html](https://github.com/atom/language-html). I also disable the core package language-hyperlink.
